\section{Review Comments}
Most of my comments are addressed but I advise you to add recent surveys on PQC to the paper and comment that you algorithm using Grover's still will be secure see below:

Response: We have included recent surveys on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in our paper and noted that our algorithm, which uses Grover's method, maintains security. The detailed revision is as follows:

Although quantum computing has enhanced capabilities to attack ciphers, as highlighted by Darzi et al. [27] and Canto et al. [28], it's worth noting that the CRAFT cipher demonstrates resistance to the probabilistic algorithm, based on quantum computing, proposed by Grover et al. [29].
