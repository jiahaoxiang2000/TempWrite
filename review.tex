\section{Review Comments}

This paper introduces new, compact hardware architectures for the SM4 cipher, realized by minimizing the data path. The authors suggest two unique methods, "split-and-join" and "off-peak and stagger". These methods improve the usability of SM4 in environments with limited resources, allowing the cipher to function efficiently with low area usage. However, there are some errors in the figures and tables, and certain sentences are confusing. Here are some comments on the paper:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Section 1: The references to SIMON[3] and SPECK are unclear. Please clarify the reference for SPECK.
    \item It would be helpful to add a table illustrating the differences between M-I, M-II, and M-III. The current numerical representation is hard to understand.
    \item Section 2 (SM4): The details of the SM4's sbox are missing. Please include these details.
    \item Section 3: Consider reorganizing the "Design and Analysis" section. Grouping the design and implementation together might make the design easier to understand.
    \item Figure 2 needs a more detailed explanation. Some arrows associated with the XOR gate are missing.
    \item The title of Figure 5 is incorrect. It should refer to both linear and nonlinear transformation.
    \item Table 1 should include the area consumption of the multiplexer.
    \item Table 2: The S-box is loaded twice. Please clarify this with a footnote.
    \item Figure 22 has an error in the middle subfigure and the third row. It currently reads "X35 X35", but it should be "X35 X33".
    \item Table 7: The throughput is consistent across different frequencies. This is unusual for SM4-32bit and SM4-4bit on the SMIC 180 nm. Please provide an explanation if this is the case.
