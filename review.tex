\section{Review Comments}

This paper discusses the implementation of the AES and Salsa20 algorithms and evaluates their power consumption efficiency. However, it lacks innovation and the results are predictable. The paper could be improved. Detailed comments are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The title does not accurately reflect the content. While the paper evaluates the AES and Salsa20 algorithms, it does not cover all Encryption Schemes for RFID Systems. The consideration of lightweight cryptography algorithms is notably absent.
    \item The paper's organization could be clearer. The Abstract and Introduction sections only present the work's objectives and results, without detailing the methods and processes. This could lead to confusion for readers.
    \item The paper does not provide a clear motivation for the work. The authors should explain why their approach could improve power consumption efficiency, rather than simply conducting an experiment without providing a rationale.
    \item In the section on figures and equations, the figures lack clear explanations. Additionally, the equations are not numbered, which makes them difficult to understand.
    \item The results presented in the paper are not convincing due to the lack of comparison with similar work. This makes it challenging to evaluate the quality of the results.
    \item Lastly, the references used in the paper are outdated. For example, the cryptanalysis paper referenced is not the most recent, which could undermine the paper's credibility.
