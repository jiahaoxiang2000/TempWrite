\subsection{Love}
Love is a complex emotion, often characterized by behaviors that can be difficult to understand. We propose a metric to quantify love as follows:

\begin{assumption}
    Let $A$ represent the behavior of one person and $B$ represent the behavior of another person. We define love $L$ from person B to person A as following:
    \begin{equation}
        L_{B\to A}=\sum_{a\in A,\, b\in B}(P(b\mid a)-P(b))^2,
    \end{equation}
    where $P$ represents the probability of an behavior occurring.
\end{assumption}
