\section{Introduction}
Love is a complex emotion, often characterized by behaviors that can be difficult to understand. We want to more deeply understand love by modeling on the mathematical.

\section{Modeling}
\subsection{Basic Definitions}
The love is between two people, denoted as $a$ and $b$, there $a,b\in P$. We define the love between $a$ and $b$ as $\{(a,b)|L(a,b)\}$. The love is not the symmetric relation, i.e., $L(a,b)\neq L(b,a)$.
